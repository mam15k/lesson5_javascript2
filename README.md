### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One concept I learned during this lesson how to clear the tax bracket. For example, the last thing we did on the HTML for the tax calculator was trying to clear the tax estimate and tax bracket. These were not clearing because they were set to an equation. So I copied the same code except I set the code to nothing instead of an equation so the tax estimate and tax bracket would clear when the button was pushed.
2. In this lesson I also learned that you can acutally use math in these codes. 
3. I also learned that the getElementById() value pulls the inner HTML of whatever element is needed in the document.
